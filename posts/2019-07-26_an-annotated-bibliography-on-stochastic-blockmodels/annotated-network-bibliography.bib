	abstract = {Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors. Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities. The stochastic blockmodel [Social Networks 5 (1983) 109--137] is a social network model with well-defined communities; each node is a member of one community. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes "misclustered" by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in this paper are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to study spectral clustering under the stochastic blockmodel, we first show that under the more general latent space model, the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically converge to the eigenvectors of a "population" normalized graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for spectral clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization technique. Our method of studying the eigenvectors of random matrices is original.},

	abstract = {This paper uses the relationship between graph conductance and spectral clustering to study (i) the failures of spectral clustering and (ii) the beneﬁts of regularization. The explanation is simple. Sparse and stochastic graphs create a lot of small trees that are connected to the core of the graph by only one edge. Graph conductance is sensitive to these noisy “dangling sets”. Spectral clustering inherits this sensitivity. The second part of the paper starts from a previously proposed form of regularized spectral clustering and shows that it is related to the graph conductance on a “regularized graph”. We call the conductance on the regularized graph CoreCut. Based upon previous arguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger inequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering. Simple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to small cuts in the graph.},

We show that, generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular we demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coeﬃcients cannot identify causal eﬀects, and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual’s enduring traits and their choices, even when there is no intrinsic aﬃnity between them.

	abstract = {Given matrices X,Y ∈ Rn×K and S ∈ RK×K with positive elements, this paper proposes an algorithm fastRG to sample a sparse matrix A with low rank expectation E(A) = XSY T and independent Poisson elements. This allows for quickly sampling from a broad class of stochastic blockmodel graphs (degree-corrected, mixed membership, overlapping) all of which are speciﬁc parameterizations of the generalized random product graph model deﬁned in Section 2.2. The basic idea of fastRG is to ﬁrst sample the number of edges m and then sample each edge. The key insight is that because of the the low rank expectation, it is easy to sample individual edges. The naive “element-wise” algorithm requires O(n2) operations to generate the n × n adjacency matrix A. In sparse graphs, where m = O(n), ignoring log terms, fastRG runs in time O(n). An implementation in R is available on github. A computational experiment in Section 2.4 simulates graphs up to n = 10, 000, 000 nodes with m = 100, 000, 000 edges. For example, on a graph with n = 500, 000 and m = 5, 000, 000, fastRG runs in less than one second on a 3.5 GHz Intel i5.},

Extant research suggests that statistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more diﬃcult when the edges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the asymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also non-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the expected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically small.},

These models combine global parameters that instantiate dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with local parameters that instantiate node-speciﬁc variability in the connections (mixed membership).

Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks.

Many deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile. However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local variational techniques. Using toy data sets as well as the French Political Blogosphere network and the transcriptional network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we compare our work with other approaches.},

Here, we develop a generalized framework for clustering networks on the basis of higher-order connectivity patterns. This framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges. The framework reveals higher-order organization in a number of networks, including information propagation units in neuronal networks and hub structure in transportation networks. Results show that networks exhibit rich higher-order organizational structures that are exposed by clustering based on higher-order connectivity patterns.},

When studying cascades, researchers typically assume that the number of active peers when a node adopts is equivalent to the node's threshold for adoption. This assumption is rarely justified due to the “opacity problem”: networked cascades reveal intervals which contain thresholds, rather than point estimates. Existing approaches take the maximum of each node's threshold interval, which biases models of social influence. Opacity is inevitable in many small graphs when using the threshold model, resulting from the networked process itself rather than data collection techniques. Using simulation, we extend this finding to the probabilistic SI (independent cascade) model. We confirm these theoretical results by studying 50 large hashtag cascades among 3.2 million Twitter users, finding that 20\% of adoptions suffer from opacity. Different assumptions in response to opacity qualitatively change conclusions about peer influence. While opacity is a far-reaching problem, it can be addressed. Using information from nodes who have tightly bounded intervals allows building models to reduce error in estimating node thresholds.},

Two previous studies have examined the statistical estimation performance of spectral clustering and the maximum likelihood estimator under the high dimensional model; neither of these results allow K to grow faster than N 1/2. We study a model where, ignoring log terms, K can grow proportionally to N . Since the number of clusters must be smaller than the number of nodes, no reasonable model allows K to grow faster; thus, our asymptotic results are the “highest” dimensional. To push the asymptotic setting to this extreme, we make additional assumptions that are motivated by empirical observations in physical anthropology (Dunbar, 1992), and an in depth study of massive empirical networks (Leskovec, Lang, Dasgupta, and Mahoney, 2008). Furthermore, we develop a regularized maximum likelihood estimator that leverages these insights and we prove that, under certain conditions, the proportion of nodes that the regularized estimator misclusters converges to zero. This is the ﬁrst paper to explicitly introduce and demonstrate the advantages of statistical regularization in a parametric form for network analysis.},

Here we show that under common conditions the eigenvector centrality displays a localization transition that causes most of the weight of the centrality to concentrate on a small number of nodes in the network. In this regime the measure is no longer useful for distinguishing among the remaining nodes and its efficacy as a network metric is impaired. As a remedy, we propose an alternative centrality measure based on the nonbacktracking matrix, which gives results closely similar to the standard eigenvector centrality in dense networks where the latter is well behaved, but avoids localization and gives useful results in regimes where the standard centrality fails.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10582},
	abstract = {A common graph mining task is community detection, which seeks an unsupervised decomposition of a network into groups based on statistical regularities in network connectivity. Although many such algorithms exist, community detection’s No Free Lunch theorem implies that no algorithm can be optimal across all inputs. However, little is known in practice about how different algorithms over or underﬁt to real networks, or how to reliably assess such behavior across algorithms. Here, we present a broad investigation of over and underﬁtting across 16 state-of-the-art community detection algorithms applied to a novel benchmark corpus of 572 structurally diverse real-world networks. We ﬁnd that (i) algorithms vary widely in the number and composition of communities they ﬁnd, given the same input; (ii) algorithms can be clustered into distinct high-level groups based on similarities of their outputs on real-world networks; (iii) algorithmic differences induce wide variation in accuracy on link-based learning tasks; and, (iv) no algorithm is always the best at such tasks across all inputs. Finally, we quantify each algorithm’s overall tendency to over or underﬁt to network data using a theoretically principled diagnostic, and discuss the implications for future advances in community detection.},

	abstract = {Spectral clustering is a fast and popular algorithm for ﬁnding clusters in networks. Recently, Chaudhuri et al. [1] and Amini et al. [2] proposed inspired variations on the algorithm that artiﬁcially inﬂate the node degrees for improved statistical performance. The current paper extends the previous statistical estimation results to the more canonical spectral clustering algorithm in a way that removes any assumption on the minimum degree and provides guidance on the choice of the tuning parameter. Moreover, our results show how the “star shape” in the eigenvectors–a common feature of empirical networks–can be explained by the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel and the Extended Planted Partition model, two statistical models that allow for highly heterogeneous degrees. Throughout, the paper characterizes and justiﬁes several of the variations of the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of these models.},

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},
