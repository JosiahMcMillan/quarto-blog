The claim was made by someone who people seem to respect on twitter which is already a bad sign, but it was such an extraordinary claim and the plot presented was a Kernel Density Estimation plot so the whole thing reeked of Hákarl. \n\n![Status on Twitter only flows to the best people](./images/silly_claim.png){width=80%}\n\nI even went into the author's [substack post](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/education-isnt-what-it-used-to-be) that this plot was used in order to see if there were any additional pieces of evidence that should suggest that there are mentally retarded PhDs out there. But alas I couldn't find any, just some general information about the decline in IQ among people at higher educational levels due to increased acceptance rates in those programs. \n\nBut on the [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016028962200023X) cited where the [data](https://osf.io/rdza3/files/osfstorage?view_only=3071b1bbf15044f3acfc643b5a14f277) comes from we can look into the definition for higher education they use as well as the distribution of underlying IQs and see if these track with the claim above. \n\nThe internal model most people should have for how this works is that there is some effort-IQ matrix that determines a person's ability to get into a university and to some degree we should not expect low effort low IQ people to be able to achieve post-graduate education. Low IQ low effort people may be able to complete easier programs, and as those programs grow with time their scholarship may decrease. It shouldn't surprise us to think that there are some changes to the composition of programs, more film studies, art, and journalism Master programs exist nowadays which may have less stringent standards than other more academic disciplines. So to some degree there may be more people enrolled in universities overall but the same or fewer people enrolled in graduate programs. This could explain some degree of change in the IQs of people who have completed these programs over time. \n\nA similar compositional challenge could explain the distribution of IQs of the \"Graduate or Professional\" study participants, no distinction is made between Master and Ph.D programs in the study cited:\n\n![Twitter brings out the best in people](./images/educational_codes.png){width=80%}\nBecause of this piece alone one can already cast serious doubt that there are \"mentally retarded PhDs\", there may only be mentally retarded Masters degree holders. We can't know given the data provided!\n\nTo the data itself we can do some basic observation and some bootstrapping to check if there is room to say that there are mentally retarded Graduate or Professional degree holders. From the raw data provided by the authors for replication we can see that there are no individuals who hold an advanced degree and have an IQ under 70 on either the test or retest. \n\n\n::: {.cell hash='mentally_retarded_phds_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_1f89824c15c6789e3534e7d5ccd36fe6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(fitdistrplus)\nlibrary(irr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tseries)\nlibrary(moments)\nset.seed(123)  \n\n\npublic_data <- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/public_data.csv\")\n\ngrad_data <- public_data %>% filter(ED_A >= 5)\n\n# maybe:\ngrad_data$IQ_A <- ifelse(grad_data$COHORT_A == 1, grad_data$IQ_A - 4.4, grad_data$IQ_A)\n\n\nprint(min(min(grad_data$IQ_A, na.rm=TRUE), min(grad_data$IQ_RETEST_A, na.rm=TRUE)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 73\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plots, of course, show this as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='mentally_retarded_phds_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_0392f7f7864775d5909c9a0f3700cb6b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(grad_data, aes(x = IQ_A)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Count of Values in Column\",\n       x = \"Values\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels if needed\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mentally_retarded_phds_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(grad_data, aes(x = IQ_RETEST_A)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Count of Values in Column\",\n       x = \"Values\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 142 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_count()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mentally_retarded_phds_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='mentally_retarded_phds_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_afd1b235811c32eb7ff02d29876406c8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrad_data$iq_diff <- grad_data$IQ_RETEST_A - grad_data$IQ_A\ngrad_data$age_diff <- grad_data$AGE_A - grad_data$AGE_RETEST_A\n\ngrad_data_comp <- grad_data%>% tidyr::drop_na(age_diff, iq_diff)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can check if the full IQ data for the initial test are normally distributed, have excess kurtosis, and plot them against the quantile-quantile norm graph.

Remember, this includes Masters programs and PhD programs and the process of getting into a PhD program is more stringent than getting into a Master program in the United States.\n\n\n# Using the bootstrap to check how many people we should expect to be mentally retarded\nOkay, now we have come to characterize this data a bit, we know that it is non-normal and light tailed. Lets set those two characteristics aside and consider how we might be able to use assumptions of normality to guess there are more mentally retarded people in the graduate degree holding population than there actually are.

And that's without even getting into the weeds on whether individual papers should be considered good evidence for a phenomena or not (they shouldn't).\n\n# But I thought his real name was Walter White Jr.\nAnd another gripe I've had with the paper that I've mostly held my tongue to in the above parts is that I don't think that a Flynn effect of 4.4 points in 7 years is reasonable to correct for. I think mostly this reflects the authors trying to get more data into their cutoff point and rather than checking what an average adjustment might be between testing periods they just norm the groups by subtracting the difference in points from the one with a higher mean. If there was some legitimate difference between the groups it was washed away by that treatment and is not well considered. If I use the uncorrected values below it shrinks the number of sub-70 IQ degree holders estimated by the KDE by nearly half.\n\n![Author justification](./images/flynn.png){width=80%}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='mentally_retarded_phds_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-18_1bd647438d1270f1aabe609ecf15471f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrad_data$IQ_A <- ifelse(grad_data$COHORT_A == 1, grad_data$IQ_A + 4.4, grad_data$IQ_A)\n\nkde <- density(grad_data$IQ_A, kernel = \"triangular\", n = 2048)\n\nkde_function <- approxfun(kde$x, kde$y, rule = 2)\n# Calculate the area under the curve for x < 70\narea_low_iq <- integrate(kde_function, lower = 20, upper = 70)$value\ncat(\"Area under the KDE curve for x < 70:\", area_low_iq, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nArea under the KDE curve for x < 70: 0.0005543884 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlow_iq_students <- area_low_iq*10000\ncat(\"number of students per 10000 with x < 70:\", low_iq_students, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nnumber of students per 10000 with x < 70: 5.543884 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo where does that leave us? Well, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Based on the methodological issues, statistical artifacts, and hidden subgroups of this study nobody should use it to claim that there are mentally retarded PhDs out there. It doesn't follow from any of the evidence laid out in the study, it can't even be done if we take KDE and the data used here as ground truth because we can't know which individuals received PhDs or not.\n\nIn general we should more carefully read the studies which we cite as evidence, be aware that most studies are bad in some way or another and disbelieve extraordinary claims without thoughtful and careful analysis. If someone makes these types of claims often you should probably ensure they are being highly careful or use evidence like this post to downgrade your assessment of confidence in that person going forward.\n",
