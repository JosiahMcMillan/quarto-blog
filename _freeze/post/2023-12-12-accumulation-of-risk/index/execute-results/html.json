Suppose you are setting up an anchor at the top of a climb, and you don't tether into something secure, so there's a 2% chance you fall while you work. If you take this risk 20 times, the probability that you fall off a cliff at least once is 33%. That's really high. Far too high for me.\n\nThe numbers above are made up, but the point is that I'm hoping to climb outside for a long time. Climbing is dangerous, and I have a certain risk budget that I am willing to allocate to climbing because I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll even do big risky things! But it's important to me that I don't exceed my risk tolerance, and I suspect I am most likely to that by accumulating small risks without paying attention.\n\nDiatribe aside, I find myself referring back to this figure on a regular basis, and I'm posting it here so that I can point other people to some rough numbers as well. \n\n\n::: {.cell .column-body-outset layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to toy around with the numbers and make your own figure, you should be able to do that by changing the values in the `p_event` and `time` variables below and then hitting the `Run Code` button.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-align: center\n#| column: body-outset\n#| out-width: 100%\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nexpand.grid(\n  p_event = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10),\n  time = 1:50\n) |> \n  transform(\n    p_at_least_one_event = 1 - pbinom(0, time, p_event),\n    p_event = as.factor(p_event)\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(time, p_at_least_one_event, color = p_event)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Risks accumulating with repetition\",\n    x = \"Years\",\n    y = \"Probability of at least one event\",\n    color = \"Event chance\\neach year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(12)\n```\n",
