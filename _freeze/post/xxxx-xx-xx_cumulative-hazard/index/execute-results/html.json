Sometimes when talking with other climbers I get the impression that they are blas√© about risk, especially for things that are a little bit dangerous, but not outright scary.\n\nThe thing about small risks is that we can comfort with them. But when we take small risks repeatedly, the danger quickly accumulates. Suppose you are setting up an anchor at the top of a climb, and you don't tether into something secure, so there's a 2% chance you fall while you work.\n\nIf you take this risk 30 times, the probability that you fall off a cliff at least one is 33%. That's really high. Far too high for me.\n\nI'm hoping to climb outside for a long time. Climbing is dangerous, and I have a certain risk budget that I am willing to allocate to climbing because I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll even do big risky things! But it's important to me that I don't excited my risk budget, and to do that, I find it valuable to consider how the danger of adverse events accumulates over time.\n\nAnyway, diatribe aside, I find myself refering back to this figure on a regular basis, and I'm posting it here so that I can refer other people to it as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-body-outset layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\np_at_least_one_event <- function(p_event = 0.1, periods = 50) {\n  tibble(\n    time = 1:periods,\n    # equivalently: 1 - pbinom(0, 1:periods, p_event)\n    p_at_least_one_event = 1 - (1 - p_event)^(1:periods)  \n  )\n}\n\ntibble(\n  p_event = seq(0.01, 0.1, by = 0.01)\n) |> \n  mutate(\n    curve = map(p_event, p_at_least_one_event),\n    p_event = forcats::fct_inseq(as.factor(p_event))\n  ) |> \n  unnest(c(curve)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(time, p_at_least_one_event, color = p_event)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Risks accumulating with repetition\",\n    x = \"Years\",\n    y = \"Probability of at least one event\",\n    color = \"Event chance\\neach year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(16)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
