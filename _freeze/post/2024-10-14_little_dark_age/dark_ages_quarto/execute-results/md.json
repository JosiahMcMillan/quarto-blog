This data generating process is a bit suspect to say the least, but it's what we have. One thing that interested me however was how this image ended out getting something interesting a bit wrong, that is that there appears to be a composition effect to the dark ages vs what would be expected in other situations. Three editions of the image have been floating around and all of them have issues with composition, that is the main driving force of the dark ages appears to be driven by the shift to Macedonian Hegemony and later Roman Hegemony over the country and then subsequently by the rise of countries that before had little to no development at all under the Romans. Some of the lack of Greek notables may be due to a lack of utilization of Greek nor of Turkish as we would expect those language groups to potentially house more granular data about their respective notables.. the Greek and the Turkish language wikipedias are ~250,000 and ~620,000 articles respectively.\n\n\nFrom the [data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4#Sec28) that the original poster used there's the following bit of information:\n>  Using the relevant urls corresponding to human biographies, we scraped the 7 following Wikipedia language editions: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Swedish that we call hereafter the European editions. Within the sample of individuals with at least one biography in the 7 language editions, 52.8% have 1 biography, 18.1% have 2 biographies (cumulative 70.9%), 8.7% have 3 biographies (cumulative 79.6%), 5% have 4 biographies (cumulative 87.8%) and 12.2% have 5 biographies or more.\n\nSo we can see that there's not a lot of overlap of biographies and we should expect that there will be individuals who are covered in Greek and Turkish but not in these other European languages.\n\nThe other issue is that citizenship status in the Roman Empire includes countries that the original writer didn't consider in the Dark Ages such as Egypt or in other cases people who in other eras would be said to have \"Greek\" citizenship based on geography end out getting ascribed their Roman citizenship in this case which means its hard to see whether the Fall of the Western Roman Empire is being accurately described by the data as Greece was still under the control of the Byzantine Empire for hundreds of years after the fall of Rome. Taking the \"Roman_Empire\" tagged individuals and running them through \"ChatGPT o1-preview\" with the following prompt:\n>\"For each of the following, return the birthplace or if unknown, the place where these individuals mostly lived through their lives. Use cities where applicable and also modern countries that encompass these cities. Return the results in a csv format:\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we can see that some number of our \"Roman_Empire\" individuals are not from Western Europe such as Hypatia who lived and died in Alexandria in modern day Egypt so there is clearly some issue with this label going forward for discussing the Dark Ages. Hopefully you can see the necessity of splitting up this label for this analysis. So I used ChatGPT to enrich this data and provide the more applicable geographic bounds for these people. Hopefully these are mostly correct, it passed my spot check but you can check here in case there were hallucinations.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_filtered <- un_petite_subset_trois %>%\n  filter(citizenship_1_b == \"Roman_Empire\")\n\nto_be_determined <- unique(df_filtered$name)\nhead(to_be_determined, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Caelestius\"                                 \n [2] \"Aquila_Romanus\"                             \n [3] \"Ticonius\"                                   \n [4] \"Cornelius_Labeo\"                            \n [5] \"Crepereius_Calpurnianus\"                    \n [6] \"Hypatia\"                                    \n [7] \"Aurelius_Opilius\"                           \n [8] \"Diomedes_Grammaticus\"                       \n [9] \"Plozio_Crispino\"                            \n[10] \"Publius_Cornelius_Scipio_Africanus_(priest)\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNow even if we restrict our countries to the core territories of the Western Roman Empire (sans Greek) we can see a different graph than we expected.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nHere are the functions that are used later on, this basically takes the data and then applies century labels to it and also handles the plotting. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Function to convert year to century\nyear_to_century <- function(year) {\n  century <- ceiling(abs(year) / 100)\n  if (year < 0) {\n    paste(century, \"BCE\")\n  } else {\n    paste(century, \"CE\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n# Define the plotting function with background shading for Dark Ages\nplot_citizenship_by_century <- function(data, citizenship, max_century = NULL, highlight_start = 6, highlight_end = 10) {\n  \n  #

This notable scholars metric doesn't work well here because in the 9th and 10th centuries the number of notable scholars is well placed among the heights of the Roman Empire and if we take the Dark Ages to be somewhat ironclad we should then restrict ourselves to only saying the 6th-8th Centuries are the Dark Ages. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nresult <- plot_citizenship_by_century(main_data, c(\"Italy\", \"France\", \"Spain\", \"Germany\", \"Switzerland\", \"United Kingdom\"), max_century = 11)\n\nprint(result$plot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dark_ages_quarto_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you want to check out other combinations of countries in Western Europe and how that influences the number of Notable Scholars throughout this time period you can check out the [Shiny App](https://brasidas.shinyapps.io/dark_ages_app/) I put together.\n\n\n## Maps can provide sanity checks\n\nJust to continue on the pedantry as well, look at the following graphs that were the subject of this debate.
