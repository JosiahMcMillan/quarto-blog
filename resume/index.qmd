Statistical methodologist | open source R developer | data scientist

I excel at digging around in data, developing new methods to solve scientific and business problems, translating real-world problems in statistical problems, producing production-grade code that plays with others, understanding when inference is causal, with a track record of successful remote work

##### Research Intern, [Core Data Science][cds], Facebook (May 2020 - October 2020)

[cds]: https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science/

- Developed novel measure of non-stationarity to assess stability of classifier calibration over time
- Contributed production implementation of non-stationarity metric and calibration method
- Used results to help client teams understand and trust measures of content prevalence
- Internship extended to write conference manuscript based on my work

##### Intern, [RStudio][rstudio] (June 2018 - October 2018)

[rstudio]: https://www.rstudio.com/

- Maintained and became author of the open-source R package [`broom`](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom) (750K+ downloads/month)
- Clarified API contracts and enforced consistency with new test suite
- Oversaw 40+ pull requests and 80+ bug fixes from dozens of contributors
- Developed extensive guidelines and support materials for contributors
- Internship extended into additional consulting work

**N.B.:** For the last several years, I written code purely for the purposes of furthering my academic research. The goal of this code is not be broadly usable. I only commit to maintaining and explaining my research code to the extent that it is assists others in their own academic research. I have also written code designed for broad consumption -- see [#rstats](#rstats) below for some details about my open source work.

My research code, as well as miscellaneous personal projects in various stages of completion, lives on my [Github](https://github.com/alexpghayes). I primarily use `R`, and most of my work as a developer is on methods packages. I am also a proficient Python user, and have passing exposure to SQL, Julia, and C++.
