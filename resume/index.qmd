I develop new statistical methods to solve complex problems, write code for production, and turn data into measured recommendations and understandable insights. I have a track record of clear communication with technical and non-technical audiences, working well with others, and succeeding in remote environments.

##### *Understanding the causal interpretation of network regression*

- Invented statistical method to estimate causal effects of group membership in social networks
- Enabled novel social science by developed technique for network regression to assess how individual outcomes vary with nodal information and network position, using a technique that is simple to implement and scales to network with millions of nodes
- Characterized the interpretation of network regressions by developing structural causal models and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to articulate mediating and confounding effects of group membership in social networks
- Disseminated results by presenting to fellow researchers and at academic conferences, by implementing new methods in an R package, and by authoring an academic manuscript explaining the technical details of our method

##### *Efficient data fusion to detect harmful interventions without observing an outcome*

- Developed method to estimate when experiment interventions have harmful effects on unmeasured outcomes by combining experimental and observational datasets
- Increased precision of estimates by deriving efficient semi-parametric estimators using causal machine learning techniques, while reducing computational overhead by a factor of 5000
- Determined when causal inference is possible in data fusion setting by deriving identification conditions using DAGs and the theory of structural causal models

##### *Network clustering when edges are missing via interpretable spectral embeddings*

- Designed method to embed and cluster networks when edges in the network are missing, by combining matrix completion and factor analysis techniques
- Solved computational feasible challenges by implementing specialized matrix completion methods for structured forms of missing data in R and C++, allowing method to scale from thousands of nodes to millions of nodes
- Investigated the structure of the statistics literature and detected new, sociologically interesting sub-fields in the academic record by interpreting spectral embeddings using varimax rotation

##### *Assessing trustworthiness on Twitter via Personalized PageRank*

- Assessed trustworthiness and community participation of Twitter accounts by approximating Personalized PageRank of the Twitter following graph over the public API
- Implemented flexible and generic Personalized PageRank approximation using a combination of generic-function and encapsulation object-oriented programming, using a Neo4J database to cache retrieved data and to handle unreliable behavior of the API

##### *Regularizing networks to obtain useful network embeddings*

- Provided guidance on effective strategies for regularizing network data to obtain high quality spectral embeddings that can be used for real world data analysis
- Developed and theory and conducted extensive simulations and experiments on network data to understand and interpret impact of degree regularization methods
