# Summary

## A sketch of formal quantitative inference

Let's talk about modeling, by which I mean formal modeling. At a high level, the idea of modeling is that we construct a (typically mathematical) formal system of interest.

out there is the world. we don't really understand how it works, but we would like to.

frequentists are possibilistic bayesians

**TL; DR:** Frequentists are possibilistic Bayesians using a uniform possibility prior.

One useful way to distinguish between frequentists and Bayesians is to consider how they represent a priori uncertainty. Here the story is pretty straightforward: both the frequentist and the Bayesian typically begin by constructing a likelihood function. This likelihood function is sometimes called an observation model; it describes the probability of observing data $X_1, ..., X_n$ for a given set of parameters $\theta$. 

##

in both cases you specify a set of possible observational models (often via a likelihood) indexed by some parameter theta

That is, frequentist procedures can be thought of as specifying an observation model and a possibility measure of the parameters of the observation model and then conditioning the prior possibility measure on observed data to produce a posterior possibility measure.
