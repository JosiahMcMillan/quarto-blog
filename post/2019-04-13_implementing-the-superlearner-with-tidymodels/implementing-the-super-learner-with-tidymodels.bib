  abstract = {Super learning is a general loss based learning method that has been proposed and analyzed theoretically in van der Laan et al. (2007). In this article we consider super learning for prediction. The super learner is a prediction method designed to find the optimal combination of a collection of prediction algorithms. The super learner algorithm finds the combination of algorithms minimizing the cross-validated risk. The super learner framework is built on the theory of crossvalidation and allows for a general class of prediction algorithms to be considered for the ensemble. Due to the previously established oracle results for the crossvalidation selector, the super learner has been proven to represent an asymptotically optimal system for learning. In this article we demonstrate the practical implementation and finite sample performance of super learning in prediction.},
