model.matrix expansion defaults - c code, lots of potential edge cases, i don't have the time, but i think documented in the blue (white?) book?

coefficients versus marginal means. use emmeans

estimable contrasts (unbiased / identifiable) condition, how to check by hand and computationally. does the contrast have an interpretation? relation between coefficient and cell means, hint at the many possible coding matrices and their hell (historical aside: R used to use helmert encodings because they were efficient, link bill venerables note on this)

marginal means versus just displaying the reference level (again depends on coding)
