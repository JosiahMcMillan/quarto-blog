	abstract = {The conventional approach to parametric model fitting of time series is realized through the comparison of various competing models by some ad hoc criterion. Since each of the models is usually specified by the parameters determined by the information from the data, the extension of the classical concept of likelihood to this situation is not obvious. By asking the log likelihood of a model to be an unbiased estimate of the expected log likelihood of the model, a reasonable definition of the likelihood is obtained and this allows us to develop a systematic approach to parametric time series modelling. Practical utility of this approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The smearing estimate is proposed as a nonparametric estimate of the expected response on the untransformed scale after fitting a linear regression model on a transformed scale. The estimate is consistent under mild regularity conditions, and usually attains high efficiency relative to parametric estimates. It can be viewed as a low-premium insurance policy against departures from parametric distributional assumptions. A real-world example of predicting medical expenditures shows that the smearing estimate can outperform parametric estimates even when the parametric assumption is nearly satisfied.},

	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Researchers and data-analysts often use the linear regression model for descriptive, predictive, and inferential purposes. This model relies on a set of assumptions that, when not satisﬁed, yields biased results and noisy estimates. A common problem that can be solved in many ways – use of less restrictive methods (e.g. generalized linear regression models or non-parametric methods ), variance corrections or transformations of the response variable just to name a few. We focus on the latter option as it allows to keep using the simple and well-known linear regression model. The list of transformations proposed in the literature is long and varies according to the problem they aim to solve. Such diversity can leave analysts lost and confused. We provide a framework implemented as an R-package, trafo, to help select suitable transformations depending on the user requirements and data being analyzed. The package trafo contains a collection of selected transformations and estimation methods that complement and increase the breadth of methods that exist in R.},
