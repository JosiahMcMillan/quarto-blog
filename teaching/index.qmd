None.

## past courses

I enjoy teaching a fair amount but have not taught since my first year of graduate school due to funding that has allowed me to focus on research. Based on my teaching in the 2018-2019 academic year I received Statistics Department Outstanding TA award.

**Undergraduate Teaching Assistant**

Outside of academic settings, I used to devote a fair amount of time to teaching R workshops for the Rice DataSci club, and to helping people make their first open source contributions, primarily to the [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package.

## teaching material

If you are teaching an introductory statistics class in the classic "barrage of hypothesis tests" tradition, you may find my [cheatsheet on common hypothesis tests](https://github.com/alexpghayes/classic-stats-formulas) useful. I also wrote [`distributions3`](https://alexpghayes.github.io/distributions3/dev/) to be an approachable set of tools for manipulating probability distributions for intro stat students. The package [vignettes](https://alexpghayes.github.io/distributions3/dev/articles/) are designed to walk students intro stat courses though many classic hypothesis tests as well.

## mentoring

- [Nathan Kolbow](https://wid.wisc.edu/people/nathan-kolbow/) worked with me as a undergraduate RA to develop the [`neocache`](https://github.com/alexpghayes/neocache) data collection infrastructure. He is now a PhD student in Biostatistics at UW-Madison.
