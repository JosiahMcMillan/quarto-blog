I'm a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, causal mediation, and causal inference on networks.

**I am looking for a post-doc position beginning in fall 2024**. I'm particularly interested in computational and methodological projects strongly motivated by data applications! Please reach out via [email](mailto:alexpghayes@gmail.com) if my work interests you. 

I'll be speaking at the [IFDS Ideas Forum](https://ifds.info/talks/) next week about contagion in social networks.
