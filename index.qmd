I'm a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, and more recently causal inference.

I primarily use this website to write notes to my future self in the form of blog posts on topics of passing interest. These days I'm particularly interested in the foundations of statistics and statistical software design.

I am responsive on Twitter at [@alexpghayes](https://twitter.com/alexpghayes) and via [email](mailto:alexpghayes@gmail.com).
