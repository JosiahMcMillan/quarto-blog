I'm a fourth year PhD candidate studying statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before grad school, I got a degree in statistics at Rice University. I have previously interned with [Core Data Science](https://research.facebook.com/teams/core-data-science/) at Facebook and the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) team at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), conducted biostatistics research at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), and led canoe trips for [YMCA Camp Menogyn](https://www.ymcamn.org/camps/camp_menogyn).

I am advised by Karl Rohe and study community detection in stochastic blockmodels and friends using spectral methods. The central idea behind these methods is to estimate parameters in random dot product graphs by estimating their singular subspaces. On the applied side, I’ve spent a fair amount of time collecting and analyzing portions of the Twitter following graph, and studying effective regularization strategies for networks. I am also currently working with Keith Levin on network regression.

Outside of network analysis, I’m excited about semi-parametric causal inference, statistical software design, and the foundations of statistics. During my timeat Facebook, I spent some on neural hypergraph embeddings and measuring classifier calibration to predict out-of-sample performance.

You can find my research software on Github.

I am responsive on Twitter at @alexpghayes and via email.
