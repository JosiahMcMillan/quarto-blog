I'm a recent graduate with a Master's Degree in Statistics from the Katholieke Universiteit of Leuven (KU Leuven) my degree track was Theoretical Statistics and Data Science. I completed my thesis (you can download a hardcopy [here](McMillan_Masters_final.pdf)) exploring count data models specifically I characterized a family of functions which were an extension of the Poisson which had greater flexibility in the dispersion settings and compared those to other count data models including the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Model. My previous work experience was focused on marketing data. I blog about statistics and data.  


### I'm looking for a job!

- I have experience with causal inference, regression, marketing attribution models, and clustering.

- I enjoy writing about topics where I can express statistical knowledge. Two articles I enjoyed making are [this explanation of how we need to understand our data generating process when determining causality using Covid as an example](./post/2024-02-15_covid_causality/) and [this explanation of how sampling variability explains the gap between the top men and women in chess](./post/2024-02-28_chess_ratings_women/).

- I'm well-suited for roles as a statistician, data analyst, or data scientist. 

- I speak English natively and I currently speak Indonesian at around a B1 level
<!-- - I also enjoy bouldering in my spare time and climb 7a+ -->
