I'm a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, causal mediation, and causal inference on networks. I plan to graduate in spring 2024. 

I'm currently looking for remote positions, both academic postdocs and industry roles. [Learn more about hiring me](./resume/).

I blog about statistics, programming, and data. Some pieces I'm particularly proud of:

- [overfitting: a guided tour](./post/2020-01-06_overfitting-a-guide-tour/)
- [consistency and the linear probability model](./post/2019-08-31_consistency-and-the-linear-probability-model/)
- [testing statistical software](./post/2019-06-07_testing-statistical-software/)
