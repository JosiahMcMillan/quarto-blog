I'm a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, causal mediation, and causal inference on networks.

**I am looking for post-docs beginning in fall 2024**. I'm particularly interested in computational and methodological projects strongly motivated by data applications! Please reach out via [email](mailto:alexpghayes@gmail.com) if my work interests you. 


I'll be speaking at the [JSM](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2023/index.cfm) about recent work of mine at the intersection of causal mediation and network analysis. [slides](https://github.com/alexpghayes/2023-08-09-jsm-slides), [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12041)
