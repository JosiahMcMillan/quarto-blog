I'm a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, and more recently causal inference. 

I anticipate being on the post-doc job market in fall 2023. I am responsive via [email](mailto:alexpghayes@gmail.com). You can also catch me in person at the [JSM 2023](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2023/index.cfm) in August.
