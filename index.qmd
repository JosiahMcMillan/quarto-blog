I'm a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, and more recently causal inference. 

<!-- I anticipate being on the post-doc job market in fall 2024. -->

I am responsive via [email](mailto:alexpghayes@gmail.com), possibly responsive at [@alexpghayes](https://twitter.com/alexpghayes) on Twitter, and actively exploring <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@alexpghayes">Mastodon</a>.
